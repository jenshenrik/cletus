# cletus
Side scrolling shooter to get familiar with pygame

###
Built with python3, and required `pygame` to run.

Move up/down with `w`/`s` or up/down arrows, shoot
with `space`. Shoot the hippies before they reach the
left side of the screen. Collect cookies for extra lives,
but be careful not to shoot them, as you loose points doing so
