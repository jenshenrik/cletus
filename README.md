# Cookies for Cletus 
Side scrolling shooter to get familiar with pygame

### What
Built with python3, and required `pygame` to run.

Move up/down with `w`/`s` or up/down arrows, shoot
with `space`. Shoot the hippies before they reach the
left side of the screen. Collect cookies for extra lives,
but be careful not to shoot them, as you loose points doing so


### How
- Create a virtual environment to keep dependencies local to the project
  (optional). `python3 -m venv cletusenv`. Activate the environment. `source
  cletusenv/bin/activate`.
- Install dependencies. `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- Run the game `python main.py`.
