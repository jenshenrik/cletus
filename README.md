# Cookies for Cletus 
Side scrolling shooter to get familiar with pygame

### What
Built with python3, and required `pygame` to run.

Move up/down with `w`/`s` or up/down arrows, shoot
with `space`. Shoot the hippies before they reach the
left side of the screen. Collect cookies for extra lives,
but be careful not to shoot them, as you loose points doing so


### How
- (Optional) Create a virtual environment `python3 -m venv cletusenv`. 
  Activate the environment `source cletusenv/bin/activate`. This step is
  optional, but recommended to keep dependencies local to the project.
- Install dependencies `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- Run the game `python main.py`.

If you skipped the virtual environment chances are you'll have to substitube
`python` for `python3` and `pip` for `pip3` in the commands above.
